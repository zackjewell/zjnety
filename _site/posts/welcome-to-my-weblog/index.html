  <p>After many years of rambling about the open web and how I want to start writing more I am finally starting that. I have enough brain space now to actually sit down and start getting thoughts out in this form. Also time but...you know...that is also a premium.</p>
<p>This whole process getting from nothing to being able to write and get thoughts out has been an uphill battle. I really don't mind if anyone reads this, if you are reading this &quot;Hi!&quot; I was trying to think about the goals for this and my site and I went back into my reading list and remembered a post by <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/">Ethan Marcotte</a> about his website being a &quot;worry stone&quot; and when I reread that it clicked with me.</p>
<p>What clicked is...this is mine. This is where I tinker. I was looking for something that I could use my and learn new skills. It could be writing, a new CSS trick I want to try out or some new JavaScript that I want to work on. I have a list of 100 things I want to do and learn but have never found the space to do it in my day job. But here...here I can do that. I had fought to give myself the permission</p>
<p>The other thing that clicked with me recent was...I miss the old web. I miss the personal feel of sites and the ownership. Now everything is being siloed off or walls being put in place to make sharing harder and it sucks. A lot of the modern web sucks and I want to feel like I own at least a little part of it where my voice is the only one. I want this space to reflect who I am and what I am. It is going to be dirty and messy and that excites me.</p>
<p>I am going to work towards that excitement.</p>
