						<h3>OKLCH and Me</h3>
						<em>Sun, 04 Jun 2023 00:00:00 GMT</em>
					</header>
					<p>One of the things in CSS that has alway been interesting to me is color spaces. RGB, HSL, and now OKLCH. When listening to a recent episode of <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/564/">ShopTalk Show</a> Chris and Dave were talking about OKLCH and hi-def color spaces (this was followed up in another <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/565/">episode</a>) and they went a little deep (I believe they called it &quot;mouth blogging&quot; a term that I love.) into color space talk. As someone who is trying to push myself into expanding my skills I did a little bit more research and practice on this.</p>
<h2>OKLCH vs HSL vs RGB</h2>
<p>HSL and RGB have been the kings for as long as I can remember and it made little sense to move on from them. It was a sturggle for me to implement HSL here on this site. &quot;Why? RGB is good enough...&quot; was my thinking but when reading into OKLCH I made the choice to update this site to it after a little experimenting.  RGB has always been this arcane magic of numbers and letters in the 3 colors (Red, Green and Blue duh) and have always been confusing* and HSL I only really used in print/photo areas. OKLCH is more &quot;human&quot; readable with its values of Lightness, Chroma and Hue. Adjusting these values allow a slightly easier and better control of the color you are working with. That alone was enough for me to consider moving to this space. This fantastic post from <a href="https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/oklch-in-css-why-quit-rgb-hsl">Evil Martians</a> was a huge help in helping me understand and wrap my head around the what and why of these spaces.</p>
<h2>Ok...So this site...</h2>
<p>Since my site features some vibrant colors. I wanted to present those as best as I could. While experimenting with the Big Three Spaces I found the OKLCH space to be a little easier and better to work with and I saw this as an opprotunity to implement this on my site. I wanted to use this to really push and show off the colors I use in both light and dark versions of my site. I took my colors and went to convert them from RGB to HSL and OKLCH color values. OKLCH allows me to push the vibrancy and the gamut of my colors to the best they can be. This will help show them off on screens that can take advantage of them.</p>
<p>So...colors are complicated and I am learning more day by day about the differences in color on the web. It is more complicated and wide than I had known. I am very excited to start learning and experimenting more in this and really seeing what they can offer to me in this site and in my day to day work.</p>
<p>Up next? Layout.</p>
