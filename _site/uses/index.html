						<p>I recently found the site <a href="http://uses.tech">uses.tech</a> and I fell in love with it. I find myself inspired by workspaces and seeing how people organize, set up and use spaces and different tools for creativity and getting work done.</p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>27 inch iMac (2017):</strong> My main workhorse. I use it for just about everything. I love this machine to death. Probably should upgrade the RAM.</li>
<li><strong>13 inch MacBook Air (2018):</strong> Bought this right before an update (Classic move). This is my travel machine. I think I could do everything with it on some occasions.</li>
<li><strong>13 inch MacBook Pro:</strong> Got this when (well a little after) I started my job at <a href="http://www.bindable.com">Bindable</a>. I use it with an external monitor. I mostly just use it for work.</li>
<li><strong>Keychron K2:</strong> Decided to upgrade to a mechanical keyboard. I wanted something wireles and that I could switch between devices easily. I got one that has &quot;quiet&quot; keys since I have no preference. Only issue I have is some squeaking keys.</li>
<li><strong>Apple Magic Trackpad:</strong> Mostly for swiping through spaces and pinch zooming while designing.</li>
<li><strong>Logitech MX Master 2S:</strong> Used a Magic Mouse for years but compounding wrist pain inspired me to get a new more ergonomic mouse. Love this thing. Mine is white but age/dirt made it a little browner in places.</li>
<li><strong>Kanto YU2 Speakers:</strong> Wanted to upgrade the speaker to my computer. Got these on sale. Pretty good but not great.</li>
<li><strong>Beats Wireless Studio 3:</strong> Invested in these for the limited travel I do and to block out neighbors.</li>
<li><strong>Apple AirPods Pro:</strong> Super useful. Mostly use them when I am going places and don't want to lug my large headphones around.</li>
<li><strong>iPhone 11 Pro:</strong> Decided to upgrade from my X. I like the extra lenses and the screen. I doubt I will go for the “Pro” phone next time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Software</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual Studio Code:</strong> The best. Easy to use. Expandable. I could list the Extensions I use but I keep it pretty simple around here. If you think I am crazy then hit me up and tell me what I should use.</li>
<li><strong>Transmit:</strong> I have been a Panic fan for since I got my first Mac. I use this for file sharing and for when I have to use FTP for some site. It happens. Might as well use a great program for it.</li>
<li><strong>Firefox:</strong> I use this as my main browser. I do most of my browsing and development work here. I will swap to Chrome and Safari when I want/need to test in other things. Might look at Edge too.</li>
<li><strong>Apple Music:</strong> I used Spotify forever but some app changes and me getting an Apple Watch made me rethink this. I don’t keep a lot of playlists and pretty much just shuffle artists or albums.</li>
<li><strong>Things:</strong> I barely remember my life before Things. I use this for almost everything. Work, Personal Errands and everything else goes in here. I have ideas for trips, side projects and weightlifting goals in here. Wonderful for my productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Spark:</strong> I recently switched to using this over Gmail and Mail.app. I had too many issues with the iOS apps and a friend suggested this to me.</li>
<li><strong>Figma/Sketch/Illustrator:</strong> I go between all of these. I use Figma the most because it is incredibly easy to use and runs in a browser. Something about using the thing I am designing for…makes sense you know? Illustrator is a great tool for some things and I have the occasional print project that pops up and this is invaluable.</li>
<li><strong>Discord/Slack:</strong> Great for communication and interacting with communities and my friends.</li>
<li><strong>1Password:</strong> Much like Things I have a hard time remembering my life before this. The Firefox Extension is the best version too.</li>
<li>I am probably forgetting something else.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Everyday Carry</h2>
<p>Inspired by Peter McKinnon(Link to one of his EDC videos) and Adam Savage(Link to The Verge piece). This is stuff I carry with me every day that makes my life just a little easier. I like to avoid saying ‘I wish I had this…’</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trayvax OG 2.0 Wallet:</strong> An all-metal “minimal” wallet. Holds all my cards and some cash. Can use it as a pry bar. I haven’t lost it since I got it.</li>
<li><strong>Trayvax Link:</strong> A fantastic lanyard. It has a QD release so I can get my keys off easier.</li>
<li><strong>Gerber Shard:</strong> Small multitool that attaches to my keys. It has two screwdrivers, bottle opener and is a pry bar. Pretty handy. I use it at least once a day.</li>
<li><strong>A Pocket Knife:</strong> Let me tell you...It is very useful to have a knife sometimes. I have a few I switch between.</li>
<li><strong>Papermate Sharpwriter:</strong> Cheap, reliable pencil. I have about 10 scattered around. Best pencil ever.</li>
<li><strong>A Pen:</strong> I have a number of these. I try to have at least one on me or in my bag.</li>
<li><strong>Gym Items:</strong> Let not get into this…</li>
</ul>
