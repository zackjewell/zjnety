<h2 id="my-work">My Work</h2>
<h3 id="websites-mostly">Websites...mostly</h3>
<p>I started my web design career as Responsive Web Design was bursting onto the World Wide Web. I have worked on many web projects and the vast majority have been responsive web sites. I want to build sites that follow best practices and are as accessible to as many people as they can be. I also have extensive experience building/maintaining pattern libraries and working with existing code bases and branding guidelines.</p>
<h3 id="what-am-i-doing-right-now">What am I doing right now?</h3>
<p>Right now? Probably working because I sometimes can't turn my brain off. Ok, but really...I am currently a designer and front-end developer for a rad InsurTech company called <a href="http://www.bindable.com">Bindable</a>. What do I do? I make websites. Shocker, right? I design and build out sites for our IaaS (That's <em>Insurance as a Service</em>) partners and enterprise partners. I do a lot and work hard when I am not cracking a joke in Slack.</p>
<h3 id="some-groups-companies-i-have-worked-with">Some Groups/Companies I Have Worked With</h3>
