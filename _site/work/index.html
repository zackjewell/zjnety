				<h1>What have I worked on?</h1>

<h2 id="websites...mostly" tabindex="-1">Websites...mostly</h2>
<p>I started my web design career as Responsive Web Design was bursting onto the World Wide Web. I have worked on many web projects and the vast majority have been responsive web sites. I want to build sites that follow best practices and are as accessible to as many people as they can be. I also have extensive experience building/maintaining pattern libraries and working with existing code bases and branding guidelines.</p>
<p>My experience has provided me with the opportunity to work with a wide range of clients, always with a focus on design and development. This background gives me a valuable perspective on how to work with different types of teams and individuals. I perform well in a variety of environments, and I am deeply knowledgeable about a lot of topics inside the design and development world. My experience ranges from small one-off projects with solo entrepreneurs to complex projects with large corporations. I am passionate about design and development that drives results.</p>
