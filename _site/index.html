		<p>My experience has been in end-to-end design and development. I have helped jump-start projects, assisted in creating and maintaining websites, apps and experiences and come in and help guide projects through the final stages. I have also taken projects from concept to flushed out expereinces.</p>
<p>Overall, My goal is to create and work on the web and are accessible regardless of browser type, device and connection speed. What does that mean? I like fast websites that everyone can look at one anything. Phone? Totally. TV? Sure. Smart fridge? Why not. I am always learning and bettering myself to make the web a better place. I have also taken websites and made them function on browsers as old as IE6. That was <em>fun.</em></p>

		<h3>I design and build websites.</h3>
<p>I have a unique background where I have worked for companies both large and small. This gives me a unique perspective on how to work with people and teams. I work well in all types of environments. I am deeply knowledgable about a lot of topics inside the design and development world (and outside.) I have worked with regional credit unions and banks to interior designers. This has given me a unique view and experience.</p>
<p>You can check out some of my selected work <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Responsive Web Design</h4>
<p>I started my web design career right as Responsive Web Design was bursting (flexing?) onto the world wide web. I have worked on many web projects and the vast majority have been responsive web sites. Every website should be available to as many devices and services as it can. My goal is to make every website accessible to as many people as I can.</p>
<h4>Performance</h4>
<p>Have you ever been to a website and notice it loading slow? Or fail to load at all (a personal favorite)? Is it one of the 43 Javascript files the site has maybe it is giant <a href="https://twitter.com/wilto/status/63284673723375616?lang=en">image of a salad</a>? I aim to make websites load as fast as possible. I look at how every site loads and what I can do to make it better. When building a new site Performance is one of the first items I think about.</p>
<h4>Companies I have worked with</h4>
<p>Crossfit Arsenal, NeoFight Pro, One Tree Press, Mario Russo Salon, Rakks, Water Taxi of Fort Lauderdale, Unipower, Barnsley Gardens Resort, Black Dolphin Inn, Bogue Watch, Sisters Cove/Nest Homes, New Seabury, Rough Hollow Lakeway, Browns Landing, Daily Precast, Peckham Industries, Modern Funding, DebtX, Combat Zone Wrestling, PCT Credit Union, Riverworks Credit Union, Mechanics Cooperative Bank, Strategis, Holyoke Credit Union, Luso Credit Union</p>
