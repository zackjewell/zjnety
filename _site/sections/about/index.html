		<h2>I am a Web Designer and Front-end Developer or as I sometimes say <em>The Unholy Abomination of a Designer and a Developer</em>.</h2>
<p>If you would like to learn more about me check <a href="#">this</a> out. You can read some of my <a href="/archive">recent posts</a> or drop me a <a href="mailto:zack.jewell@gmail.com">line</a> to talk more.</p>

	<h2 class="shaded">I like building websites.</h2>
	
	
	
	<div class="copy">
		<p>My experience has provided me with the opportunity to work with a wide range of clients, always with a focus on design and development. This background gives me a valuable perspective on how to work with different types of teams and individuals. I perform well in a variety of environments, and I am deeply knowledgeable about a lot of topics inside the design and development world. My experience ranges from small one-off projects with solo entrepreneurs to complex projects with large corporations. I am passionate about design and development that drives results.</p>
<p>If you want more check out this <a href="/about">page</a></p>
<h3>What else do I enjoy?</h3>
<p>When I am not working I can be found at the gym, at the movies and diving into various side projects. I am also a semi-regular at (one of) my local wrestling promotion. I love designing t-shirts and going on photography shoots. I am always looking for new and interesting ways to use and further develop my skills.</p>

		<h3>Websites...mostly</h3>
<p>I started my web design career as Responsive Web Design was bursting onto the World Wide Web. I have worked on many web projects and the vast majority have been responsive web sites. I want to build sites that follow best practices and are as accessible to as many people as they can be. I also have extensive experience building/maintaining pattern libraries and working with existing code bases and branding guidelines.</p>
<h3>What am I doing right now?</h3>
<p>Right now? Probably working because I sometimes can't turn my brain off. Ok, but really...I am currently a designer and front-end developer for a rad InsurTech company called <a href="http://www.bindable.com">Bindable</a>. What do I do? I make websites. Shocker, right? I design and build out sites for our IaaS (That's <em>Insurance as a Service</em>) partners and enterprise partners. I do a lot and work hard when I am not cracking a joke in Slack.</p>
<h3>Some other Groups/Companies I Have Worked With</h3>
<p>Arsenal Performance, NeoFight Pro, Windmill Press, Mario Russo Salon, Rakks, Water Taxi of Fort Lauderdale, Unipower, Barnsley Gardens Resort, Black Dolphin Inn, Bogue Watch, Sisters Cove/Nest Homes, New Seabury, Rough Hollow Lakeway, Browns Landing, Daily Precast, Peckham Industries, Modern Funding, DebtX, Combat Zone Wrestling, PCT Credit Union, Riverworks Credit Union, Mechanics Cooperative Bank, Strategis, Holyoke Credit Union, Luso Credit Union, WASDA</p>
