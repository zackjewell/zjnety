    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Oh man, what a year! I always read these types of posts when I come across my RSS feeds. A great way to check in with yourself and see how far you have come or not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this writing unlocks a real opportunity to reflect on life and whether or not we’re living in alignment with our values and enthusiasms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bradfrost.com/blog/link/2025-another-year-of-blog-on-the-desktop-again-live-laugh-blog/&quot;&gt;Brad Frost&lt;/a&gt; covers why I think this is a great type of writing and why I am writing my own post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2024 was a transitional year, but one that, as I look back, I see how much I grew this year. Growing my hobbies away from the computer and trying to rebuild some old and good habits like reading, journaling, and, you know, eating well. I had ups and downs on all of these, but I really enjoyed that path of discovering what did and did not work with these. Well, the eating well, I know about that I just…like chips…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journaling is something I will probably touch on more in the future. My system is pretty simple and not elaborate as others. I try to keep it easy since I don’t want to waste too much time on something I think shouldn’t…blah blah…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to 2024…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set some lofty goals for myself in 2024, and I think I got some, but I also didn’t, and that’s okay! I reset some goals and ambitions, and I feel like I am on a more fulfilling path heading into 2025. Kind of wild that a little reset and realignment can put you on a better path. My goals seem much more in line with what I want in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, 2024 was a year of realignment, and 2025 I seek out to build on that realignment. I am ready to put in the work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Welcome to my Weblog</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After many years of rambling about the open web and how I want to start writing more, I am finally starting that. I have enough brain space now to actually sit down and start getting thoughts out in this form. Also, time, but...you know...that is also a premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole process of getting from nothing to being able to write and get thoughts out has been an uphill battle. I really don&#39;t mind if anyone reads this. If you are reading this, &amp;quot;Hi!&amp;quot; I was trying to think about the goals for this and my site, and I went back into my reading list and remembered a post by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/&quot;&gt;Ethan Marcotte&lt;/a&gt; about his website being a &amp;quot;worry stone,&amp;quot; and when I reread that, it clicked with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What clicked is...this is mine. This is where I should tinker. I have been looking for something that I could use myself and learn new skills. It could be writing, a new CSS trick I want to try out, or some new JavaScript that I want to work on. I have a list of 100 things I want to do and learn but have never found the space to do it in my day job. But here...here I can do that. I had fought to give myself the permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing that clicked with me recently was...I miss the old web. I miss the personal feel of sites and the ownership. Now everything is being siloed off or walls being put in place to make sharing harder, and it sucks. A lot of the modern web just sucks, and I want to feel like I own at least a little part of it where my voice is the only one. I want this space to reflect who I am and what I am. It is going to be dirty and messy, and that excites me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to work towards that excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
