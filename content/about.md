Hey. Hi. I am Zachary or Zack (Why a K? Long story.) I am Web and UI Designer and Developer for [Bindable](https://www.bindable.com). I live in Boston, MA. 

When I am not working I can be found at the gym, at the movies and diving into my photography. I love both digital and film photography and enjoy both. I am always looking for new and interesting ways to use and further develop my skills not only in the web but also as a photographer.

You can check out some of my photography on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zachjewellphoto).
