February (and January...) were hectic, and I didn't get a lot of writing done for the blog.

## Media
**Watched**
- _Dragon Ball Z_: Wanted to revisit an old classic. I thought about watching _Kai_, but went with the OG and skipped some of the filler. Still a classic.
- _Doc Martin_: A British comedy-drama that my parents enjoy. Good characters and great scenery.

**Read**
- Started _Second Foundation_. No notes yet.

I’ve started working on my journaling and note-taking habits. I really enjoyed Peter McKinnon's video about how he uses his system. I adapted his to mine, and so far, I've really liked it. It's nice to keep track of things.

## The Other Stuff
Still hitting the gym consistently. BJJ has been up and down—I’ve hit a plateau in my training and am looking for the next techniques to work on. Picked up a small injury, which doesn’t help. Started walking more!

Looking ahead, I'm hoping to get more writing and work done on my site. More on that soon.

Cheers!
