Again another series/topic I am ripping off from others. I love a behind the scenes look at what other writers are up too. Dave Rupert’s Vibe Check ([https://daverupert.com/tag/vibecheck](https://daverupert.com/tag/vibecheck)) series is one that I like a lot. When I ready these it reminds me to take a step back and work on myself as well.

and keep track of all the media I consume...or at least try to.

## Movies
[**Ghostbusters: Afterlife**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4513678/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_6_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_Ghostbu)(Link to IMDB) ★★★☆☆
A movie I wanted to watch when it came out but missed. Overall I enjoyed it but felt like a movie for kids in a weird way. I did like McKenna Grace. Might watch Frozen Empire next. 
## Books
[**Foundation and Empire**](https://bookshop.org/p/books/foundation-and-empire-isaac-asimov/11418077?ean=9780553293371&next=t&next=t)(Link to bookshop.org USA) ★★★★★
I have slowly been reading the original Asimov _Foundation_ series after watching the show on Apple TV. These are way better stories and setting than the show. Which I like for different reasons.

## TV
I probably watch too much TV if I am honest but this month I mostly watched murder mysteries like Dagliesh from AcornTV. I recently started rewatching Dragonball Z as well! A real mix of shows. More to come.

I am working on creating and building out a regular schedule for posting and what to post about. I should have a regular series about this site and the work I want to do to improve my skills but also this site.

## Gym
I spend my evenings at the gym where I hangout with my friends but also working on my fitness. These days I am working on Olympic Weightlifting and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Both have a balance of what my body and mind needs. I need 

Cheers!
