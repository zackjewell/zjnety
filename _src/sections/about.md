My experience has provided me with the opportunity to work with a wide range of clients, always with a focus on design and development. This background gives me a valuable perspective on how to work with different types of teams and individuals. I perform well in a variety of environments, and I am deeply knowledgeable about a lot of topics inside the design and development world. My experience ranges from small one-off projects with solo entrepreneurs to complex projects with large corporations. I am passionate about design and development that drives results.

### What else do I enjoy?
When I am not working I can be found at the gym (Iâ€™m a certified weightlifting trainer), at the movies and diving into various side projects. I am also a semi-regular at (one of) my local wrestling promotion. I love designing t-shirts, going on photography shoots and helping out around my community. I am always looking for new and interesting ways to use and further develop my skills.
