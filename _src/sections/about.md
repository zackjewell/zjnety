I am a Web Designer and Front-end Developer or as I sometimes say "The Unholy Abomination of a Designer and a Developer."

Just don't call me a "Devigner"...because just *ugh*...

My experience has been in end-to-end design and development. I have helped jump-start projects, assisted in creating as well  maintaining websites, apps and experiences and come in and help guide projects through the final stages. I have also taken projects from concept to flushed out expereinces. 

Overall, My goal is to create and work on the web and are accessible regardless of browser type, device and connection speed. What does that mean? I like fast websites that everyone can look at one anything. Phone? Totally. TV? Sure. Smart fridge? Why not. I am always learning and bettering myself to make the web a better place. 

If this is something you are looking for or can help with drop me a [line](mailto:zack.jewell@gmail.com) and by line I mean e-mail. I am not a fish...I think.
