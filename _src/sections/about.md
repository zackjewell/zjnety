My experience has provided me with the opportunity to work with a wide range of clients, always with a focus on design and development. This background gives me a valuable perspective on how to work with different types of teams and individuals. I perform well in a variety of environments, and I am deeply knowledgeable about a lot of topics inside the design and development world. My experience ranges from small one-off projects with solo entrepreneurs to complex projects with large corporations. I am passionate about design and development that drives results. I can provide work samples as well if requested.
