### I design and build websites. 
I have a unique background where I have worked for companies both large and small. This gives me a unique perspective on how to work with people and teams. I work well in all types of environments. I am deeply knowledgable about a lot of topics inside the design and development world (and outside.) I have worked with regional credit unions and banks to interior designers. This has given me a unique view and experience. 

You can check out some of my selected work [here](#).

#### Responsive Web Design
I started my web design career right as Responsive Web Design was bursting (flexing?) onto the world wide web. I have worked on many web projects and the vast majority have been responsive web sites. Every website should be available to as many devices and services as it can. My goal is to make every website accessible to as many people as I can. 

#### Performance
Have you ever been to a website and notice it loading slow? Or fail to load at all (a personal favorite)? Is it one of the 43 Javascript files the site has maybe it is giant [image of a salad](https://twitter.com/wilto/status/63284673723375616?lang=en)? I aim to make websites load as fast as possible. I look at how every site loads and what I can do to make it better. When building a new site Performance is one of the first items I think about.
