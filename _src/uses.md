I recently found the site [uses.tech](http://uses.tech) and I fell in love with it. I find myself inspired by workspaces and seeing how people organize, set up and use spaces and different tools for creativity and getting work done.

## Hardware
- **13 inch MacBook Pro:** Got this when (well a little after) I started my job at [Bindable](http://www.bindable.com). I use it with an external monitor. I mostly just use it for work.
- **Logitech MX Master 3:** Used a Magic Mouse for years but compounding wrist pain inspired me to get a new more ergonomic mouse. Love this thing.
- **Apple AirPods Pro:** Super useful. Mostly use them when I am going places and don't want to lug my large headphones around.
- **iPhone 11 Pro:** Decided to upgrade from my X. I like the extra lenses and the screen. I doubt I will go for the “Pro” phone next time. 

## Software
- **Visual Studio Code:** The best. Easy to use. Expandable. I could list the Extensions I use but I keep it pretty simple around here. If you think I am crazy then hit me up and tell me what I should use.
- **Firefox:** I use this as my main browser. I do most of my browsing and development work here. I will swap to Chrome and Safari when I want/need to test in other things. Might look at Edge too. 
- **Apple Music:** I used Spotify forever but some app changes and me getting an Apple Watch made me rethink this. I don’t keep a lot of playlists and pretty much just shuffle artists or albums.
- **Figma/Sketch/Illustrator:** I go between all of these. I use Figma the most because it is incredibly easy to use and runs in a browser. Something about using the thing I am designing for…makes sense you know? Illustrator is a great tool for some things and I have the occasional print project that pops up and this is invaluable.
- **Discord/Slack:** Great for communication and interacting with communities and my friends.
- **1Password:** Much like Things I have a hard time remembering my life before this. The Firefox Extension is the best version too.
- I am probably forgetting something else.

## Everyday Carry
Inspired by Peter McKinnon(Link to one of his EDC videos) and Adam Savage(Link to The Verge piece). This is stuff I carry with me every day that makes my life just a little easier. I like to avoid saying ‘I wish I had this…’
- **A Pocket Knife:** Let me tell you...It is very useful to have a knife sometimes. I have a few I switch between.
