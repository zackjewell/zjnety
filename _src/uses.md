I recently found the site [uses.tech](http://uses.tech) and I fell in love with it. I find myself inspired by workspaces and seeing how people organize, set up and use spaces and different tools for creativity and getting work done.

## Hardware
- **27 inch iMac (2017):** My main workhorse. I use it for just about everything. I love this machine to death. Probably should upgrade the RAM.
- **13 inch MacBook Air (2018):** Bought this right before an update (Classic move). This is my travel machine. I think I could do everything with it on some occasions.
- **Apple Wireless Fullsize keyboard:** I had a wired version from a number of years ago that I loved that died and I shed a small tear. I used a small wireless one for a while but I hated the arrow keys with a burning passion. Would like to upgrade to a mechanical keyboard at some point.
- **Apple Magic Trackpad:** Mostly for swiping through spaces and pinch zooming while designing.
- **Logitech MX Master 2S:** Used a Magic Mouse for years but compounding wrist pain inspired me to get a new more ergonomic mouse. Love this thing. Mine is white but age/dirt made it a little browner in places.
- **Kanto YU2 Speakers:** Wanted to upgrade the speaker to my computer. Got these on sale. Pretty good but not great.
- **Beats Wireless Studio 3:** Invested in these for the limited travel I do and to block out neighbors.
- **Apple AirPods:** Super useful. Ugly. Recently lost the case. That was smart.
- **iPhone 11 Pro:** Decided to upgrade from my X. I like the extra lenses and the screen. I doubt I will go for the “Pro” hone

## Software
- **Visual Studio Code:** The best. Easy to use. Expandable. I could list the Extensions I use but I keep it pretty simple around here. If you think I am crazy then hit me up and tell me what I should use.
- **Numi:** A simple and very pretty calculator app. I use it as a running check sheet for dimensions like padding, margin and font size just to make my life a little easier. I pretty much have it running all the time.
- **Hyper:** A terminal replacement. It is a little nicer and I like the icon. I do most of my command line work in Visual Studio Code but sometimes I just want to separate the tasks. Also nice when I (rarely) SSH into something.
- **Transmit:** I have been a Panic fan for since I got my first Mac. I use this for file sharing and for when I have to use FTP for some site. It happens. Might as well use a great program for it.
- **Firefox:** I use this as my main browser. I do most of my browsing and development work here. I will swap to Chrome and Safari when I want/need to test in other things. Might look at Edge too. 
- **Apple Music:** I used Spotify forever but some app changes and me getting an Apple Watch made me rethink this. I don’t keep a lot of playlists and pretty much just shuffle artists or albums.
- **Things:** I barely remember my life before Things. I use this for almost everything. Work, Personal Errands and everything else goes in here. I have ideas for trips, side projects and weightlifting goals in here. Wonderful for my productivity.
- **Trello:** I use this as a brainstorming area usually. Is it what it was designed for? Probably not but anything in here usually ends up in Things.
- **Spark:** I recently switched to using this over Gmail and Mail.app. I had too many issues with the iOS apps and a friend suggested this to me. 
- **Figma/Sketch/Illustrator:** I go between all of these. I use Figma the most because it is incredibly easy to use and runs in a browser. Something about using the thing I am designing for…makes sense you know? Illustrator is a great tool for some things and I have the occasional print project that pops up and this is invaluable.
- **Discord/Slack:** Great for communication and interacting with communities and my friends.
- **1Password:** Much like Things I have a hard time remembering my life before this. The Firefox Extension is the best version too.
- I am probably forgetting something else.

## Everyday Carry
Inspired by Peter McKinnon(Link to one of his EDC videos) and Adam Savage(Link to The Verge piece). This is stuff I carry with me every day that makes my life just a little easier. I like to avoid saying ‘I wish I had this…’
- **Trayvax OG 2.0 Wallet:** An all-metal “minimal” wallet. Holds all my cards and some cash. Can use it as a pry bar. I haven’t lost it since I got it.
- **Trayvax Link:** A fantastic lanyard. It has a QD release so I can get my keys off easier. 
- **Gerber Shard:** Small multitool that attaches to my keys. It has two screwdrivers, bottle opener and is a pry bar. Pretty handy. I use it at least once a day.
- **Papermate Sharpwriter:** Cheap, reliable pencil. I have about 10 scattered around. Best pencil ever.
- **A Pen:** I have a number of these. I try to have at least one on me or in my bag.
- **SanDisk 128GB Drive:** Small USB/USB-C thumb drive that I keep around for when I need to move files around fast or with someone.
- **Nike Backpack:** Black packpack that I carry around everything. Simple and big because I also keep my gym stuff in the smaller pocket and change of clothes.
- **Office Pouch:** I need a better name for this bag. My philosophy for my backpack is “I should have everything I need to get through a day or more in here.” So I keep an assortment of supplies like pens, pencils, battery and a few other things in here in case I need it. 
- **Gym Items:** Let not get into this…
