I was the sole designer and developer on this project so I controlled the process from concept to deployment. This small businessâ€™s primary goal was to create a "white glove" service for housekeeping and relocation services.

Working closely with the clients I helped flesh out naming of services, how to describe their "white glove" service.

The site was built on Wordpress for easy updating and maintenance. I used a partially built theme for an unused site as a base and recoded most (pretty much all...) of the theme to fit modern standards, with performance and accessibility in mind.
