For this project, I provided a questionnaire to the client, a bestselling author, and talked with her about the purpose of the site and what she wanted to accomplish with it. The main goals were to provide readers with information about her books and news on upcoming releases and events.

I used Wordpress as a back-end since the client was familiar with it and it has the functionality we required for organization of a substantial number of books, routine upkeep, blogging and expandability. The site was built and designed for ease of use for users and the client.

Currently, I maintain and update the site with new features as well as manage a monthly e-mail newsletter with 45-50,000 subscribers via Constant Contact.
