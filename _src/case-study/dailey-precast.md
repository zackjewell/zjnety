# Dailey Precast

## Role
Lead Developer

Content Strategy

## Skills
HTML

JavaScript

I was part of a two person team tasked with the design development of the site fop Dailey Precast. The main goal was to provide contractors with information about the company's history, capabilities and wide range of past projects.

The parent company's website used Expression Engine and I continued its use since the stakeholders at the company were familiar with it and we could get started right away with code base ready to go.

A major component of the site development was creating a custom JavaScript-powered portfolio section for filtering different types of projects and integrating it with Expression Engine.
