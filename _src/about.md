### I want to know about you
For the past 15 years, I have been lset of building and working on the web. From designing sites to building them to be acessible and performant. I started building sites for my favorite show growing up (Mobile Suit Gundam Wing) on Geocities using dirty Image Maps and Dreamweaver. I was set on becoming a desginer and when I wanted to see the things I designed actually work I got more into development and here we are.

### What else do I enjoy?
When I am not working I can be found at the gym, on a photo walk or diving into various side projects. I am also a semi-regular at (one of) my local wrestling promotion. I love designing t-shirts and going on photography shoots. I am always looking for new and interesting ways to use and further develop my skills.
