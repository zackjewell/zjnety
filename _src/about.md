### What do you want to know?
For the past 15 years, I have been lset of building and working on the web. From designing sites to building them to be acessible and performant. I started building sites for my favorite show growing up (Mobile Suit Gundam Wing) on Geocities using bad Image Maps and Dreamweaver. I was set on becoming a desginer and when I wanted to see the things I designed actually work I got more into development and here we are.

### Future Work
I am passionate about the web and the technology that runs it. I am most interested in the presentation layers of the web, The "Front of the Front End" if you will. Brad Frost has a great [write up](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/) up about this work. Basically, I want to be in a position where I can influence design to help build accessible experiences from the start. I am able to focus on using HTML, CSS and Javascript to use (and build) design/component libraries, help with performance and cross-browser testing.

### What else do I enjoy?
When I am not working I can be found at the gym, on a photo walk or diving into various side projects. I am also a semi-regular at (one of) my local wrestling promotion. I love designing t-shirts and going on photography shoots. I am always looking for new and interesting ways to use and further develop my skills.
