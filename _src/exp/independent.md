I partner with organizations to identify and remediate potential user-facing concerns, from the earliest design phases to production deployment. This work is often equal parts technical and cultural: in an ideal engagement, I’m not only there to audit and fix their performance, accessibility, and usability pain points, but to help establish workflows, development habits, and support systems that will allow the results to persist long after I’m gone.

Recent projects include:

* Providing ongoing accessibility-focused auditing, documentation, prototyping, and direct contribution to Microsoft’s MWF and Fluent Web component libraries, both in isolation and in context (the former of which powers all public-facing Microsoft properties; eg [microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/), [xbox.com](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/)). Responsibilities included one-on-one training, group workshops, and weekly “accessibility office hours” for internal partner teams making use of the shared libraries.
* Identifying and remediating potential performance and accessibility issues with the shared components and compiled WordPress base theme that powers [Penske Media Corporation](https://pmc.com/) publications (eg [variety.com](https://variety.com/), [rollingstone.com](https://www.rollingstone.com/)).
