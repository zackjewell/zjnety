During my time at Filament Group, I was able to play a small role in the establishment of responsive web design as a design and development practice. My time included working alongside Ethan Marcotte on the responsive [Boston Globe](https://bostonglobe.com) project—a successful effort to prove that responsive web design was a viable approach at scale.

Responsibilities included:

* Helping to develop new approaches, techniques, and even [additions to the web platform itself](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-picture-element/) that have become responsive web design “best practices” today
* As a lead on the [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/) and, later, [jQuery Mobile](https://jquerymobile.com/) projects, I was responsible for helping to manage two massive open source component library projects—ensuring a predictable, theme-able, and fundamentally accessible front-end across countless unknowable contexts
