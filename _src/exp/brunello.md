I began my time at Brunello Creative as an intern, brought in to assist with their new web design and development offerings—a trial-by-fire approach to learning web design and front-end development. I was offered a paid full-time position after just a few weeks as an intern. Later—as dedicated web-focused staff grew—I was promoted to lead developer.

Responsibilities included:

* Day-to-day work on Brunello’s most difficult and/or highest profile design and development projects
* Providing guidance, leadership, and instruction to junior team members
